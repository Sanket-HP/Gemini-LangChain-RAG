(Around 2007, some spammers added random noise to fuzz words within \"image spam\" in order to defeat OCR-based filters.) In 2006, Marco Barreno and others published \"Can Machine Learning Be Secure?\", outlining a broad taxonomy of attacks. As late as 2013 many researchers continued to hope that non-linear classifiers (such as support vector machines and neural networks) might be robust to adversaries, until Battista Biggio and others demonstrated the first gradient-based attacks on such machine-learning models (2012–2013). In 2012, deep neural networks began to dominate computer vision problems; starting in 2014, Christian Szegedy and others demonstrated that deep neural networks could be fooled by adversaries, again using a gradient-based attack to craft adversarial perturbations.\\nRecently, it was observed that adversarial attacks are harder to produce in the practical world due to the different environmental constraints that cancel out the effect of noise. For example, any small rotation or slight illumination on an adversarial image can destroy the adversariality. In addition, researchers such as Google Brain\\'s Nicholas Frosst point out that it is much easier to make self-driving cars miss stop signs by physically removing the sign itself, rather than creating adversarial examples. Frosst also believes that the adversarial machine learning community incorrectly assumes models trained on a certain data distribution will also perform well on a completely different data distribution. He suggests that a new approach to machine learning should be explored, and is currently working on a unique neural network that has characteristics more similar to human perception than state-of-the-art approaches.\\nWhile adversarial machine learning continues to be heavily rooted in academia, large tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have begun curating documentation and open source code bases to allow others to concretely assess the robustness of machine learning models and minimize the risk of adversarial attacks.\\n\\n\\n=== Examples ===\\nExamples include attacks in spam filtering, where spam messages are obfuscated through the misspelling of \"bad\" words or the insertion of \"good\" words; attacks in computer security, such as obfuscating malware code within network packets or modifying the characteristics of a network flow to mislead intrusion detection; attacks in biometric recognition where fake biometric traits may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user; or to compromise users\\' template galleries that adapt to updated traits over time.\\nResearchers showed that by changing only one-pixel it was possible to fool deep learning algorithms.

They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\nNeural networks are typically trained through empirical risk minimization. This method is based on the idea of optimizing the network\\'s parameters to minimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and the actual target values in a given dataset. Gradient based methods such as backpropagation are usually used to estimate the parameters of the network. During the training phase, ANNs learn from labeled training data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined loss function. This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nHistorically, digital computers evolved from the von Neumann model, and operate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a number of processors. Neural networks, on the other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of connectionism. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does not separate memory and processing.\\nThe simplest kind of feedforward neural network (FNN) is a linear network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated at each node. The mean squared errors between these calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating an adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression.

This method is based on the idea of optimizing the network\\'s parameters to minimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and the actual target values in a given dataset. Gradient based methods such as backpropagation are usually used to estimate the parameters of the network. During the training phase, ANNs learn from labeled training data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined loss function. This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nHistorically, digital computers evolved from the von Neumann model, and operate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a number of processors. Neural networks, on the other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of connectionism. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does not separate memory and processing.\\nThe simplest kind of feedforward neural network (FNN) is a linear network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated at each node. The mean squared errors between these calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating an adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) also considered a non-learning computational model for neural networks.\\nIn the late 1940s, D.

In the literature, permutation equivariant layers are implemented via pairwise message passing between graph nodes. Intuitively, in a message passing layer, nodes update their representations by aggregating the messages received from their immediate neighbours. As such, each message passing layer increases the receptive field of the GNN by one hop.\\nLocal pooling: a local pooling layer coarsens the graph via downsampling. Local pooling is used to increase the receptive field of a GNN, in a similar fashion to pooling layers in convolutional neural networks. Examples include k-nearest neighbours pooling, top-k pooling, and self-attention pooling.\\nGlobal pooling: a global pooling layer, also known as readout layer, provides fixed-size representation of the whole graph. The global pooling layer must be permutation invariant, such that permutations in the ordering of graph nodes and edges do not alter the final output. Examples include element-wise sum, mean or maximum.\\nIt has been demonstrated that GNNs cannot be more expressive than the Weisfeiler–Leman Graph Isomorphism Test. In practice, this means that there exist different graph structures (e.g., molecules with the same atoms but different bonds) that cannot be distinguished by GNNs. More powerful GNNs operating on higher-dimension geometries such as simplicial complexes can be designed. As of 2022, whether or not future architectures will overcome the message passing primitive is an open research question.\\n\\n\\n== Message passing layers ==\\n\\nMessage passing layers are permutation-equivariant layers mapping a graph into an updated representation of the same graph.

It was developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Princeton University to address some limitations of transformer models, especially in processing long sequences. It is based on the Structured State Space sequence (S4) model.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture ==\\nTo enable handling long data sequences, Mamba incorporates the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). S4 can effectively and efficiently model long dependencies by combining the strengths of continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models, enabling it to handle irregularly sampled data, have unbounded context, and remain computationally efficient both during training and testing.\\nMamba, building on the S4 model, introduces significant enhancements, particularly in its treatment of time-variant operations. Central to its design is a unique selection mechanism that adapts structured state space model (SSM) parameters based on the input. This enables Mamba to selectively focus on relevant information within sequences, effectively filtering out less pertinent data. The model transitions from a time-invariant to a time-varying framework, which impacts both the computation and efficiency of the system.\\nTo address the computational challenges introduced by this time-variance, Mamba employs a hardware-aware algorithm. This algorithm enables efficient computation on modern hardware, like GPUs, by using kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. The implementation avoids materializing expanded states in memory-intensive layers, thereby optimizing performance and memory usage. The result is an architecture that is significantly more efficient in processing long sequences compared to previous methods.\\nAdditionally, Mamba simplifies its architecture by integrating the SSM design with MLP blocks, resulting in a homogeneous and streamlined structure, furthering the model\\'s capability for general sequence modeling across various data types, including language, audio, and genomics, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\\n\\n\\n=== Key components ===\\nSelective-State-Spaces (SSM): The core of Mamba, SSMs are recurrent models that selectively process information based on the current input. This allows them to focus on relevant information and discard irrelevant data, potentially leading to efficient processing.\\nSimplified Architecture: Mamba replaces the complex attention and MLP blocks of Transformers with a single, unified SSM block. This aims to reduce computational complexity and improve inference speed.\\nHardware-Aware Parallelism: Mamba utilizes a recurrent mode with a parallel algorithm specifically designed for hardware efficiency, potentially further enhancing its performance.\\n\\n\\n=== Comparison to Transformers ===\\n\\n\\n== Variants ==\\n\\n\\n=== Token-free language models: MambaByte ===\\n\\nOperating on byte-sized tokens, transformers scale poorly as every token must \"attend\" to every other token leading to O(n2) scaling laws, as a result, Transformers opt to use subword tokenization to reduce the number of tokens in text, however, this leads to very large vocabulary tables and word embeddings.\\nThis research investigates a novel approach to language modeling, MambaByte, which departs from the standard token-based methods. Unlike traditional models that rely on breaking text into discrete units, MambaByte directly processes raw byte sequences.  This eliminates the need for tokenization, potentially offering several advantages:\\n\\nLanguage Independence: Tokenization often relies on language-specific rules and vocabulary, limiting applicability across diverse languages. MambaByte\\'s byte-level representation allows it to handle different languages without language-specific adaptations.\\nRemoves the bias of subword tokenisation: where common subwords are overrepresented and rare or new words are underrepresented or split into less meaningful units.

This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution and to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples.\\n\\n\\n== Function approximation ==\\nMost of the physical laws that govern the dynamics of a system can be described by partial differential equations. For example, the Navier–Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations derived from the conservation laws (i.e., conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) that govern fluid mechanics. The solution of the Navier–Stokes equations with appropriate initial and boundary conditions allows the quantification of flow dynamics in a precisely defined geometry. However, these equations cannot be solved exactly and therefore numerical methods must be used (such as finite differences, finite elements and finite volumes). In this setting, these governing equations must be solved while accounting for prior assumptions, linearization, and adequate time and space discretization.\\nRecently, solving the governing partial differential equations of physical phenomena using deep learning has emerged as a new field of scientific machine learning (SciML), leveraging the universal approximation theorem and high expressivity of neural networks. In general, deep neural networks could approximate any high-dimensional function given that sufficient training data are supplied. However, such networks do not consider the physical characteristics underlying the problem, and the level of approximation accuracy provided by them is still heavily dependent on careful specifications of the problem geometry as well as the initial and boundary conditions. Without this preliminary information, the solution is not unique and may lose physical correctness. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) leverage governing physical equations in neural network training. Namely, PINNs are designed to be trained to satisfy the given training data as well as the imposed governing equations. In this fashion, a neural network can be guided with training data that do not necessarily need to be large and complete. Potentially, an accurate solution of partial differential equations can be found without knowing the boundary conditions. Therefore, with some knowledge about the physical characteristics of the problem and some form of training data (even sparse and incomplete), PINN may be used for finding an optimal solution with high fidelity.\\nPINNs allow for addressing a wide range of problems in computational science and represent a pioneering technology leading to the development of new classes of numerical solvers for PDEs. PINNs can be thought of as a meshfree alternative to traditional approaches (e.g., CFD for fluid dynamics), and new data-driven approaches for model inversion and system identification. Notably, the trained PINN network can be used for predicting the values on simulation grids of different resolutions without the need to be retrained. In addition, they allow for exploiting automatic differentiation (AD) to compute the required derivatives in the partial differential equations, a new class of diff')]"

Other algorithms that are similar in spirit to boosting algorithms are sometimes called \"leveraging algorithms\", although they are also sometimes incorrectly called boosting algorithms.\\nThe main variation between many boosting algorithms is their method of weighting training data points and hypotheses. AdaBoost is very popular and the most significant historically as it was the first algorithm that could adapt to the weak learners. It is often the basis of introductory coverage of boosting in university machine learning courses.

This extreme learning machine was not yet a deep learning network.\\nIn 1965, the first  deep-learning feedforward network, not yet using stochastic gradient descent, was published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa, at the time called the Group Method of Data Handling.\\nIn 1967, a deep-learning network, using stochastic gradient descent for the first time, was able to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes, as reported Shun\\'ichi Amari. Amari\\'s student Saito conducted the computer experiments, using a five-layered feedforward network with two learning layers.\\nIn 1970, modern backpropagation method, an efficient application of a chain-rule-based supervised learning, was for the first time published by the Finnish researcher Seppo Linnainmaa. The term (i.e. \"back-propagating errors\") itself has been used by Rosenblatt himself, but he did not know how to implement it, although a continuous precursor of backpropagation was already used in the context of control theory in 1960 by Henry J. Kelley. It is known also as a reverse mode of automatic differentiation.\\nIn 1982, backpropagation was applied in the way that has become standard, for the first time by Paul Werbos.\\nIn 1985, an experimental analysis of the technique was conducted by David E. Rumelhart et al.. Many improvements to the approach have been made in subsequent decades.\\nIn 1987, using a stochastic gradient descent within a (wide 12-layer nonlinear) feed-forward network, Matthew Brand has trained it to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth, using small batches of random input/output samples. He, however, concluded that on hardware (sub-megaflop computers) available at the time it was impractical, and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for a single modifiable layer.\\nIn 1990s, an (much simpler) alternative to using neural networks, although still related support vector machine approach was developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues. In addition to performing linear classification, they were able to efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, using high-dimensional feature spaces.\\nIn 2003, interest in backpropagation networks returned due to the successes of deep learning being applied to language modelling by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors.\\nIn 2017, modern transformer architectures were introduced in the Attention Is All You Need paper.\\n\\n\\n== Mathematical foundations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Activation function ===\\nThe two historically common activation functions are both sigmoids, and are described by\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n        (\\n        \\n          v\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        =\\n        tanh\\n        \\u2061\\n        (\\n        \\n          v\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n         \\n         \\n        \\n          \\n            and\\n          \\n        \\n         \\n         \\n        y\\n        (\\n        \\n          v\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        =\\n        (\\n        1\\n        +\\n        \\n          e\\n          \\n            −\\n            \\n              v\\n     '),\n",

They were known as multiplicative modules, sigma pi units, and hyper-networks. They have been used in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, multi-sensory data processing (sound, images, video, and text) in perceivers, fast weight controller\\'s memory, reasoning tasks in differentiable neural computers, and neural Turing machines.\\n\\n\\n== Core calculations ==\\nThe attention network was designed to identify the highest correlations amongst words within a sentence, assuming that it has learned those patterns from the training corpus.  This correlation is captured in neuronal weights through backpropagation, either from self-supervised pretraining or supervised fine-tuning. \\nThe example below (an encoder-only QKV variant of an attention network) shows how correlations are identified once a network has been trained and has the right weights.  When looking at the word \"that\" in the sentence \"see that girl run\", the network should be able to identify \"girl\" as a highly correlated word.  For simplicity this example focuses on the word \"that\", but in reality all words receive this treatment in parallel and the resulting soft-weights and context vectors are stacked into matrices for further task-specific use.\\n\\nThe query vector is compared (via dot product) with each word in the keys. This helps the model discover the most relevant word for the query word. In this case \"girl\" was determined to be the most relevant word for \"that\". The result (size 4 in this case) is run through the softmax function, producing a vector of size 4 with probabilities summing to 1. Multiplying this against the value matrix effectively amplifies the signal for the most important words in the sentence and diminishes the signal for less important words.\\nThe structure of the input data is captured in the Wq and Wk weights, and the Wv weights express that structure in terms of more meaningful features for the task being trained for.  For this reason, the attention head components are called Query (Wq), Key (Wk), and Value (Wv)—a loose and possibly misleading analogy with relational database systems.\\nNote that the context vector for \"that\" does not rely on context vectors for the other words; therefore the context vectors of all words can be calculated using the whole matrix X, which includes all the word embeddings, instead of a single word\\'s embedding vect'),\n",
